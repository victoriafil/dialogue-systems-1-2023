#+TITLE: Lab I. Dialogue
* Task 1. Dialogue experiment

*DEADLINE: 24/01 23:59*

In groups of three, your task is to tell each other jokes in two
different contexts -- text based chat (using discord) and video chat
(using zoom). For the text-based chat, please copy the transcript of
the dialogue after you have all told your jokes, and e-mail this to
Chris, Vlad and Fahima. For the video call, please record the dialogue
and send the recording to Chris, Vlad and Fahima.

Please contact Fahima on Discord (Fahima#1805). She will assign you to
a group and give you personalised instructions on how to proceed with
the task.

-----

* Task 2. Lab assignment write-up 
The assignment should be done on the segments of the chat which
consist of the two jokes that you yourself told in the zoom chat,
matched to the *same* jokes (told by someone else, it can be another
variant of the same joke) in the text chat.  Note that the
‘joke-telling segments’ include any build-up to the joke and the
reaction.  You may discuss the task in your groups or with others but
the write-up should be done individually.

For all Discord transcripts, see the assignment page: https://canvas.gu.se/courses/64393/assignments/200435

You may discuss the task in your groups or with others but the write-up should be done individually.

** Part A.
For both of your two jokes, think about what it is that is (supposed to be) funny about them. Many jokes revolve around managing misunderstandings, either between the characters in the joke, or in the interlocutors in the joke telling situation (such as when a joke is set up to evoke one type of situation but is revealed to be a different type of situation in the punchline). Can your jokes be described in these terms? 

** Part B.
For each of the 4 joke-telling segments (2 in zoom, 2 in text chat) please discuss the segments with respect to the following aspects. The discussion is not meant to be exhaustive and some of the factors will be more relevant in particular cases than others: 
- Turn-taking (overlapping in zoom, sequentiality in text, is the joke told in multiple segments or all at once etc) 
- Backchannels (‘yeah’, ‘okay’ ‘mm’; can also include non-verbal behaviour, e.g. nodding, smiling, laughing, emojis) 
- Self-repair/pauses (‘er’,’erm’; repeated words or phrases; reformulated words or phrases) 
- Other-repair (clarification requests ‘what?’, ‘eh?’ both within the joke and in the joke telling event) 
- Speech/dialogue acts (e.g questions/answers, requests, both in the
  talk around the joke, and in the story-world of the joke)


** Part C.
1. What differences are there in general between the two mediums (text versus zoom) in the joke telling segments you analysed? How different are the joke-tellings to the written form of the jokes? 
2. What observations can you make about the transition from one joke to another? How are they structured? Do dialogue participants use any special words?  

** Part D.

What would a ‘dream dialogue’ with a joke-telling dialogue system look like? Please provide an example of such dialogue where dialogue system first listens to a joke from the user and then takes a chance to tell another joke itself. The jokes can be different from ones in your assignment.  
 
Please ask Chris, Vlad or Fahima if you have any questions!

A concert pianist travelled to Africa in a bid to prove that music had the power to soothe the savage beast. He set up his grand piano in a small clearing beside a river, and began to play. One by one, animals appeared and soon he was surrounded by lions, giraffes, antelopes, warthogs, and leopards, all sitting peacefully together swaying and tapping their feet. The pianist had just started to play a second piece when a crocodile splashed out of the river, grabbed the man with its jaws, and dragged him into the water. An agitated lion ran over to the water’s edge. “Why in heaven’s name did you do that?” he asked. The crocodile cupped a foot to the back of its head and said, “Eh ?”
